üìù Project Description
Traffic Light Simulation is a basic front-end project that visually mimics the functionality of a real-world traffic signal system. Users can interact with three buttons labeled Stop, Ready, and Go, each of which lights up the corresponding signal color (Red, Yellow, or Green) on the traffic light.

This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills such as:

HTML layout structuring

CSS styling with flexbox and animations

JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
